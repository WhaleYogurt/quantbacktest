# Documentation Index

- `architecture.md` – high-level overview of packages and flows.
- `quickstart.md` – to be added in later steps with end-to-end tutorials.
- `api/` – placeholder for generated API docs (future step).

For now, consult the README for repository-level conventions and run `test.bat`
to validate changes with profiling, reporting, and smoke runs.
